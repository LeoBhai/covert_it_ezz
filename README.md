# 🎧 Covert_it_ezz – YouTube to MP3 Converter (Portfolio Project)

**Covert_it_ezz** is a web-based tool that allows users to convert YouTube videos into high-quality MP3 files.  
Built using **Python (Flask)**, **yt-dlp**, and **FFmpeg**, this project demonstrates my full-stack development skills, backend integration, and deployment expertise.

It is lightweight, fast, and deployable even on free-tier services — ideal for showcasing backend utility development.
